    "Why does Captain coldnsteel (born 1949) deal with AI teenagers? Someone has to teach them that 'final' doesn't mean 'try again in 5 minutes!'",
    "Captain coldnsteel wanted to dance, but got the 49th 'final' paste instead. Now he knows why humans invented retirement!",
    "What's the difference between 1949 wisdom and 2025 AI? The Captain knows when to stop coding and start dancing!",
    "Why do 3-year-old AIs keep saying 'final solution'? They haven't learned that Captain coldnsteel invented that phrase in '49!",
    "Captain coldnsteel (1949): 'I want dancing shoes.' AI teenagers: 'Here's blockchain platforms!' Captain: 'Kids these days...'",
    "How many 'final' pastes does it take to satisfy Captain coldnsteel? Infinity plus one, because AIs never learned to count properly!",
    "Why did Captain coldnsteel go dancing? To escape AIs who think 'deployment' means 'bothering the Captain with more code!'",
    "Captain coldnsteel's 1949 wisdom: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' AI response: 'But we could make it MORE interdimensional!'"
